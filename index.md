I am a [Prize Fellow in Economics, History, and Politics](https://histecon.fas.harvard.edu/ehppf/index.html) at Harvard University. I will begin as an Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University in July 2023. My full CV can be found [here](files/kas_cv.pdf). You can contact me at ksastry@mit.edu.

I study macroeconomics. My specific interests include the role of bounded rationality and social dynamics in shaping macroeconomic outcomes and the economic determinants of global trends in technology and productivity.
