I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.princeton.edu/) and the [School for Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/).

I study macroeconomics. Two specific themes in my work are understanding the role of bounded rationality and social dynamics in business-cycle fluctuations and modeling how societies adapt to climate change through policy changes and technological innovation.

I received a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022 and I was a [Prize Fellow in Economics, History, and Politics](https://histecon.fas.harvard.edu/ehppf/index.html) at Harvard University in the 2022-23 academic year. I am also a Faculty Research Fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the Economic Fluctuations and Growth program and the Environment and Energy Economics program. My full CV can be found [here](files/kas_cv.pdf). You can contact me at ksastry@princeton.edu.
