I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.princeton.edu/) and the [School for Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/).

I study macroeconomics, with broad interests that also intersect with economic theory, the economics of innovation, and environmental economics. Two specific themes in my work are understanding the role of bounded rationality and social dynamics in business-cycle fluctuations and modeling how societies adapt to climate change through policy changes and technological innovation.

I received an AB in Economics from Princeton in 2016 and a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022. I am also a Faculty Research Fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the Economic Fluctuations and Growth program and the Environment and Energy Economics program. My full CV can be found [here](files/kas_cv.pdf). You can contact me at ksastry at princeton dot edu.
