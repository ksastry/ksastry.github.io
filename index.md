I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University. I received a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022 and I was a [Prize Fellow in Economics, History, and Politics](https://histecon.fas.harvard.edu/ehppf/index.html) at Harvard University in the 2022-23 academic year.

I study macroeconomics. I am broadly interested in the interactions between information, innovation, and markets, in both theory and practice. Two specific topics that I am studying are the effects of bounded rationality and social dynamics on macroeconomic dynamics and the macroeconomic causes and consequences of technological innovation.
